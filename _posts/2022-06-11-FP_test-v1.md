## 1. Introduction

**A) Background**

사진 넣기 (last-mile delivery 급증, 빠른 배송)

Demand for fast delivery is rapidly increasing
* Early morning delivery
* Same-day delivery
* With the development of information and communication technology, e-commerce is spreading rapidly
*

**B) Purpose of Research**
* Establishment of a delivery system combining drone and public transportation
* Improve delivery efficiency by introducing drone battery charging
* Improving the applicability of this system by considering the uncertainty of link travel time of public transportation

## 2. Literature Review

**A) Drone & Public Transportation Delivery**
![Literature Review - summary.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/3-A-1_LiteratureReview.png)

**B) Link Travel Time of Public Transportation**

## 3. Methodology

**A) Choudhury et al. (2019)**

Based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), Multimodal Route Planning, and Hierarchical Stochastic Planning, we create an algorithm called DreamrHHP(Dynamic Real-time Multimodal Routing with Hierarchical Hybrid Planning)
* dd

**B) This Research(Research Plan)**

1)  Route Planning
  * Apply data analysis-based distribution to the calculation of ETA(estimated time of arrival)
  * Choudhury et al. (2019) updates the changing state and applies A* heuristic search to repeatedly plan the route of drone
  * Review the multimodal route planning methodology for better objective function values (minimizing delivery time)

## 4. Data

**A) Introduction of Data**

(1) Bus Location Data

Data description

* Source: Seoul bus location information OpenAPI
* Spatial scope of data: 8 of the bus routes that pass through Songpa-gu
  * 303, 340, 341, 401, 3313, 3412, 3414, 3417
* Temporal scope of data: 06:00 ~ 24:00, every day

Example of raw data
![Raw Data.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/4-A-1_RawData.png)

* runTm : The time when the api was called
* dataTm : The time when the location information of the bus was recorded
* sectOrd : The order of sections of a bus route

(2) Bus Route Infomation Data

Data description

* Source: Seoul bus route information OpenAPI
* Spatial scope of data: 8 of the bus routes that pass through Songpa-gu
  * 303, 340, 341, 401, 3313, 3412, 3414, 3417

Example of raw data
![Raw Data.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/4-A-2_RawData.png)

* seq : The order of sections of a bus route (= sectOrd column of bus location data)
* section : The id of a section (= sectionId column of bus location data)

**B) Data Preprocessing**
* Daily data are classified by bus route, bus vehicle ID, vehicle trip, and direction

**C) EDA**
*
