## 1. Introduction

### A) Background

**Minimizing delivery time & express delivery has become a crucial issue**

![Fast Delivery.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/1-A_FastDelivery.png){: width="500" height="100"}
* Same-day delivery
* Early morning delivery
* Rocket delivery
* . . .

The demand for speed has outstripped the capabilities of railroads, trucks, ships, and planes

Drone Delivery: A Solution to Last Mile Delivery!

**Current situations of drone delivery**

![Truck and Drone Delivery.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/1-A_TruckDrone.png)

* **Walmart**
  * expands drone delivery network providing the potential to reach 4 million U.S. households across six states (Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia) by the end of this year

* **Wing**
  * Delivering daily necessities over small and medium-sized cities in the United States, Australia, and Finland
  * 100,000 drone deliveries (2021.08)

* **Several drone delivery tests in Korea**
  * Domino Pizza Delivery at Sejong Lake Park
  * Delivery of masks in Jeju and Marado Island

* **etc**
  * COVID-19 diagnostic kit, medicine, food, deliver blood in Rwanda

### B) Purpose of Research
* Establishment of a delivery system combining drone and public transportation
* Improve delivery efficiency by introducing drone battery charging
* Improving the applicability of this system by considering the uncertainty of link travel time of public transportation



## 2. Literature Review


### A) Drone & Public Transportation Delivery

### B) Link Travel Time of Public Transportation

Rahman et al. (2018). Analysis of bus travel time distributions for varying horizons and real-time applications

* *pseudo horizon* : the distance from a GPS point to an upstream GPS point
![Pseudo Horizon.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/2-B-1_PseudoHorizon.png){: width="600" height="150"}
* analyze the changes of bus travel time characteristics as pseudo horizon varies and how such characteristics can be applied to real-time bus arrival estimation
* Instead of point estimates of bus arrival times, his study provides interval estimates that take into account the uncertainty of future bus arrival times
* Show a significant change in bus travel time characteristics around a pseudo horizon range of 8 km

## 3. Methodology


### A) Choudhury et al. (2019)

Based on 1) Markov Decision Process (MDP), 2) Multimodal Route Planning, and 3) Hierarchical Stochastic Planning, Choudhury created an algorithm called **DreamrHHP**(Dynamic Real-time Multimodal Routing with Hierarchical Hybrid Planning)

* MDP

  ![MDP.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/3-A-2_MDP.png)


### B) This Research

1)  Route Planning
  * Apply data analysis-based distribution to the calculation of ETA(estimated time of arrival)
  * Choudhury et al. (2019) updates the changing state and applies A* heuristic search to repeatedly plan the route of drone
  * Review the multimodal route planning methodology for better objective function values (minimizing delivery time)

2) Optimization of Multiple Demand Delivery

3) Multiple Drones

## 4. Data

### A) Introduction of Data

**(1) Bus Route Information Data**

Data description

* Source: Seoul bus route information OpenAPI
* Spatial scope of data: 8 bus routes that pass through Songpa-gu
  * bus route num : 303, 340, 341, 401, 3313, 3412, 3414, 3417

Example of raw data
![Raw Data.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/4-A-2_RawData.png)

Description of key variables
* seq : The order of sections of a bus route (= sectOrd column of bus location data)
* section : The id of a section (= sectionId column of bus location data)

Visualization - bus route

**(2) Bus Location Data**

Data description

* Source: Seoul bus location information OpenAPI
* Spatial scope of data: 8 bus routes that pass through Songpa-gu
  * bus route num : 303, 340, 341, 401, 3313, 3412, 3414, 3417
* Temporal scope of data: 06:00 ~ 24:00, every day

Example of raw data
![Raw Data.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-06-11/4-A-1_RawData.png)

Description of key variables
* runTm : The time when the api was called for data collection
* dataTm : The time when the location information(coordinates) of the bus was recorded
* sectOrd : The order of sections of a bus route (= seq column of bus route information data)
* sectionId : The id of a section (= section column of bus route information data)

Visualization - bus route & bus location

### B) Data Preprocessing
* Daily data are classified by bus route, bus vehicle ID, vehicle trip, and direction



### C) EDA


* runTm vs dataTm


* Histogram - travel time of single link

* Scatter plot - distance(y) vs travel time(x) of single link

* Average bus velocity in each section per hour
